### In a few sentences,  explain the structure of your project.

- First, I did the html and css.
- Second, I creared the object in javascript.
- After that, I grabbed several elements from the html.
- Then, I generated the lists of books using map() method. 
- Third, I created handleSubmit to hold the state from the inputs followed by pushing it and after, display that pushed item using string.
- I followed the method from shopping-list exercises so I took the *mirrorToLocalStorage* and *restoreFromLocalStorag functions* from that.
- Finaly, I generated the delete items and the checkbox (status) but I couldn't manage to do it. 

*Nb*: I took the delete icon frow the figma but it didn't work.


### If I had more time,

I would like continuing the delete items and the checkbox, also the css and addind more comments in my code.

### Did you learn anything new while working on this project?

Yes, I learn many things from doing this project, because it is not exactly the same as the shopping-list so I need to change several things.

### What was the most challenging part for you?

I think, all are challenging! I could follow the logic. Yet, I still need more practice.

### Would you like a new explanation about a specific topic?

I think I need more explanation about the *dispatchEvent, customEvent and local storage.*
